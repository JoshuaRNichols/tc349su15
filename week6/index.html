    "Lindy Hop, sometimes known as Jitterbug, is the original form of swing dancing which evolved in the 1920s and dominated dance halls throughout the Great Depression until World War II. It is an unabashedly joyful dance, with a solid, flowing style that closely reflects its music — from the late 20′s hot Jazz to the early 40′s Big Bands. </p>

    The name Lindy Hop was inspired by Charles Lindbergh’s flight to Paris in 1927, when the newspaper headline read: “LINDY HOPS THE ATLANTIC”.</p>

    Lindy Hop is the authentic Afro-Euro-American Swing dance. Just as Jazz combines European and African musical origins, Lindy Hop draws on African and European dance traditions. The embracing hold, and the turns are from Europe while the breakaway and solid, earthy body posture come from Africa.</p>

    Lindy Hop is a social dance. Partners are connected in a playful lead/follow relationship. The dance evolved along with the new swing music, based on earlier dances such as the Charleston and the Black Bottom, by the African American community in Harlem."</p>
