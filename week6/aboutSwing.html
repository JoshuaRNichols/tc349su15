    <h2>About Swing</h2>
    <p>Swing dance is a style of dance that was most popular from the 1920s to the 1950s. It is ususally danced to music with a syncopated "swing" rhythm, particularly jazz music. There are several types of swing dance, and our club teaches many of them. These styles are listed below, with a link that will take you to a video demonstrating that dance.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Originating in 1930s Harlem, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReVYu2ndCKU&t=0m8s" target="_blank">Lindy Hop</a> (sometimes called the Jitterbug) is the best-known form of swing dance. It is an 8-count dance that be be identified by its fundamental step: the swingout. It can be danced to fast and slow songs, though faster songs can prove to be difficult for beginners.</li>
    <li>The <a href = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS0L8LdaDpE&t=0m10s" target="_blank">Charleston</a> pre-dates the Lindy Hop. It's an 8-count dance which is characterized by its prominent kicking motions. It is typically danced to faster songs. We typically teach partner Charleston, though it can also be danced solo. There are 3 general types of Charleston that we do at State Swing:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS0L8LdaDpE&t=0m13s" target="_blank">Side-by-Side Charleston</a>: Patrners stand side by side and kick forward and backwards</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS0L8LdaDpE&t=0m51s" target="_blank">20s Charleston</a>: Partners face each other and twist their ankles instead of kick</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS0L8LdaDpE&t=0m33s" target="_blank">Tandem Charleston</a>: The follow is in front of the lead and both kick forward and backwards</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUhXdSekaxo" target="_blank">East Coast Swing</a> is a 6-count dance that is great to introduce to beginners. The steps are relatively simple and it can be danced to fast and slow songs.</li>
    <li>Originating in the early 1930s, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh6Dy9RaBeQ" target="_blank">Collegiate Shag</a> took college scenes by storm. It's a 6-count dance that is great fun to perform, and is one of the easier dances to learn. Key features include hopping, close positions, hidden signals, and finger-waving. it is best danced to a fast tempo.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0BgxtFZkoM&t=0m6s" target="_blank">Balboa</a> is an 8-count dance that works great on a crowded floor. This is because the dancers are close together and the steps in Balboa require little movement. This is more of an advanced dance and is best to a fast tempo.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3ZxiPKmacg" target="_blank">West Coast Swing</a> is related to lindy hop, but is different from the other forms of swing dance because its dancers prefer modern songs as opposed to swung songs. It also emphasizes a smoother style than its bouncy counterparts. The dance is typically 6 counts and is best with a slower tempo.</li>
